## 🔧 Development Guide

### Development Server
To start a local development server, run:
```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.  
The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding
To generate a new component, run:
```bash
ng generate component component-name
```
For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:
```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building
To build the project, run:
```bash
ng build
```
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.  
By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Running Unit Tests
To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use:
```bash
ng test
```

### Running End-to-End Tests
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:
```bash
ng e2e
```
> **Note:** Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default.  
> You can choose one that suits your needs, such as [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
